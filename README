This program was inspired by a day when me and my friends went out to dinner,
and all of us spent varying amounts on different things, anybody was paying
for anybody.

This program takes as input a file (piped into its stdin) that specifies who
spent how much, and who paid how much.

Then it crunches these numbers, and outputs who spent how much (in all), 
who paid how much and how much more has to be paid.

The syntax of the input file is illustrated by a sample input file in the
sample/ directory.

PS: this is free software. it shall stay free, never be restricted.
